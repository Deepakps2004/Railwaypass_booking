# 🚆 Railway Pass Booking — HTML Demo Project

Welcome to **Railway Pass Booking**, a simple web-based front-end concept designed to simulate the experience of booking a railway pass. Built entirely with pure HTML and creative flair, this project captures the vibe of an IRCTC-style interface without any backend processing.

> 🎨 Designed by [Deepak](https://github.com/Deepakps2004) — for the love of Indian railways, clean UI, and learning by building.

## ✨ Features

- Static web pages for pass **registration** and **booking**
- Clean and scrollable UI inspired by real-world IRCTC portals
- Responsive design elements (HTML only)
- Custom imagery to create an immersive booking feel
- Educational purpose: Great starting point for HTML beginners

## 🚫 Limitations

This is a **static project** — no backend logic, form validation, or database integration. It’s ideal for UI prototyping or HTML practice, but not meant for production use.

---

## 🎯 Future Improvements (optional)

Thinking of levelling this up?

- Add CSS styling with Bootstrap or Tailwind  
- Connect it to a Node.js backend using Express  
- Implement basic validation with JavaScript  
- Store registration data in MongoDB or Firebase  

---

## 📚 Use Case

This project was created for **educational purposes**, specifically to demonstrate:

- Static page design
- Basic form structure in HTML
- Multi-page navigation

It can be used for beginner portfolios, college assignments, or UI/UX concept showcases.
